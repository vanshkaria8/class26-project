Then once a brown, crispy color is present, flip it on it's side and let it cook for about 7 minutes on each side. Once the cooking is done, remove the steak from the pan and let it rest for 5 minutes to finish cooking and allow the juices to redistribute. Keep it warm until ready to serve.

3. Get about 2 potatoes and wash them, then peel the skin and boil the potatoes until they register at about 120° (248°F) remove them from the pot and place them into a bowl and mash. While mashing, place about a 1/4 of a stick of salted butter, 150ml of milk, and 2 tbsp of salt. Then keep mashing and mixing until it is creamy and thick. Keep it at room temperature.

4. Get a pan and heat it up to about 130°C (266°F), then add flour and milk together and mix vigorously and continuously and gradually add milk slowly until it looks like a thick, creamy rue.
